# Competitive Programming Materials

A. Roadmap:
- M1: BigO Notation & STL Library (vector, stack, queue, heap, BST, bitset)
- M2: Problem solving paradigms (2 pointers, binary/ternary search, greedy, recursion & backtracking, divide & conquer)
- M3: Dynamic Programming (dp classical, dp advanced)
- M4: Graph (dfs/bfs, topo, strongly conencted component, dijkstra algo, dsu, tree)
- M5: Mathematics (combinatorics, probability, expected value, dp + combinatorics, modular inversion, game theory)

C. Journey:

Month 1: 
  1. BigO Notation: expresses algorithm complexity (time/space complexity) used to solve a problem.
  2. Vector: a dynamic array (flexible in size) used to store elements of an array.
     

Month 2: Problem Solving Paradigms
Greedy Algorithms:
- used to solve optimization problems by trying the best choice at each iteration.
- Implementation:
Sort the list of objects
loop through the list and record optimal choices
- Examples: 
  1. Give the set of coin denominations {d1, d2, d3} and a target amount k. Return the min no.coins to make the change. Each 
  Input: denominations = {1, 2, 5, 10}, k = 21
  Output:  3
  Explanation: 10 + 10 + 1 = 21
